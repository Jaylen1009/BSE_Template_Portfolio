# The LED Cyclone game
I'm working on making a LED Cyclone game. I hope to create a game that uses different colors and becomes challenging.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was hooking the wires into the correct spots in the arduino. I plugged 3 wires in to the LED strip. Then I connected the wires to the arduino (GND, 5v, digital pin. Then used the arduino app to make the LED strip work. I used Strandtest wheel from the library.
